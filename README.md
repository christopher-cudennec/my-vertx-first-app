# My First Vert.x 4 Application

This project is a very simple Vert.x 4 application. I used https://github.com/cescoffier/my-vertx-first-app/
and upgraded it from Vertx 3 to 4.

Trying out:
* simple web application
* storing data in a MongoDB
* validate incoming data

## REST endpoints

* GET /api/whiskeys
* POST /api/whiskeys/:id
* PUT /api/whiskeys/:id
* DELETE /api/whiskeys/:id
